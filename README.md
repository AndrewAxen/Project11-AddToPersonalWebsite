# Project 10 - Add To Personal Website

## Requirements:

**Step One**

One possibility would be to apply the fade-and-slide-in effect to the content in your website’s different sections. You can use the code you just wrote in the mini-project as a guide. Another possibility would be to implement some kind of calculator, animation event, drag and drop (if you went through the AEL lesson covering that), a list creator, etc.
You can decide which of these suggestions you want to incorporate, but pick at least one.

**Step Two**

Add one or more of the mini-projects you completed this week (or something you built outside the course) to GitHub and to your personal website’s project section.

I added a fade-and-slide-in effect to the headers on the main page of my personal website.
I chose to make this change to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of my website.
The animation provides a more engaging user experience by making content appear dynamically as the user scrolls down the page.
Additionally, I added a new project 4 "String Reversal Web Tool" (which I made this week) to the "Projects" page, including an image, title, description, and a link to the GitHub repository.
This change was made to showcase my recent work and provide visitors with easy access to project details.
Overall, these additions improve the overall aesthetics and functionality of my personal website
